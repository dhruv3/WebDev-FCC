Process to create this app:
1. Skeleton of this app is setup using my [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/dhruv3/react-boilerplate).
2. Decision to create Container and Component. Container have some computation in them whereas Component just display whatever is
sent to them.
3. Initially app and its banner was created(complete styling and content).
4. Next Product and list of Product was tackled.
5. Finally logic and style for Shopping Cart was done.
